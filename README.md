# Virtual Infrastructure Monitoring

## Overview
This project provides a **monitoring solution** for virtualized infrastructure, allowing users to track key system performance metrics such as **CPU usage, memory utilization, and network activity**. It logs performance data, generates visual insights, and provides a summary of system health.

## Features
- **Automated Performance Logging** â€“ Captures real-time VM performance metrics.
- **Graphical Data Visualization** â€“ Generates graphs to analyze performance trends.
- **System Health Reports** â€“ Provides concise status updates on system health.
- **Easy-to-Use Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Run all functionalities within a single notebook.
